InertiaCalc

📌 About the Project
InertiaCalc is a Python-based GUI application for calculating the moment of inertia of various cross-sectional shapes. This project was developed as a study tool for the Computational Tools for Civil Engineering course in my Civil Engineering program at UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina).

✨ Features
✅ User-friendly graphical interface using customtkinter
✅ Image processing with PIL
✅ Moment of inertia calculations for different shapes
✅ Visualization of results using matplotlib
